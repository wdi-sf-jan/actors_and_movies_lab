# Actors and Movies - Polymorphic Lab

In this lab, you'll start with the solution code from yesterday's actors
and movies lab and add a polymorphic association allowing comments to be
left on both actors and movies.

Come up with a plan based on what you read in the pre-reading.

Work with a partner.

Please feel free to add simple_form if you wish to make life easier.

## Bonus

Implement comments by users. Youâ€™ll need to implement authentication.

## Super Bonus

Implement a polymorphic association between an `Image` entity and `Movie`/`Actor`. Basically, think about how IMDB does images for both movies and for actors.

### For photo uploads:

You may use [uploadcare](uploadcare.com), which will mean figuring out how their widget works.

Alternatively, you may use a gem like [paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip).
